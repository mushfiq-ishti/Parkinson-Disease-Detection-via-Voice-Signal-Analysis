# Parkinson-Disease-Detection-via-Voice-Signal-Analysis
A MATLAB-based project to detect Parkinson's disease using voice signal analysis and trained SVM classifier

PrakinsonVoiceFeatures_Classifier.mlx file contains all the codes used for the project

Prepared Dataset using all the voice signals in Data is stored in binary_tester_V1.mat file

To check any plot, load the .mat file and run desired sections only.

The GUI is in signals_project.mlapp file.

The ParkinsonTester.m file was created to implement in GUI.
